# 🔩 Hardware Shop Inventory & Management System
---
## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a web-based inventory and product management system designed for a hardware shop.
It enables the shop to add products, store inventory data locally, and view the stored information across multiple pages in a simple and user-friendly interface.

The project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a functional, responsive web application that solves a real-world business problem.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Many small hardware shops manage stock manually, which can lead to errors, poor tracking, and loss of information.
This application provides a simple digital solution for managing products and inventory without requiring a backend or database.

---

## ✨ Features
- Add new hardware products using a form
- Validate user input before saving data
- Store inventory data using browser localStorage
- Display products dynamically on the dashboard
- View inventory details in table format
- Display inventory statistics on the About page
- Warehouse page with dynamic inventory status
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop

## 📄 Pages Included
- Dashboard (index.html) – Displays products in card format
- Add Product (add-product.html) – Form for adding new products
- Inventory (inventory.html) – Displays inventory in a table

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML5 – Semantic page structure
- CSS3 – Styling, Flexbox, and media queries
- JavaScript – DOM manipulation, event handling, and localStorage

## 💾 Data Persistence

The application uses localStorage to store product and inventory data in the browser.
This ensures data remains available across page refreshes and navigation, as long as browser storage is not cleared.
